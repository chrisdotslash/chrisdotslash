# Hi there, I'm Chris! 👋

👨‍💻 **I'm a linguist and software developer passionate about learning and building things, with experience in JavaScript, Python, and Git.**

🤝 I'm interested in language-driven approaches to natural language processing and open to collaborate on NLP and AI projects.

⚙️ Project(s) currently in progress:

- **Polish verb conjugator** (Python) – The conjugator takes a language typological approach to the problem by grouping verbs into morphologically similar categories instead of relying on statistical models or large language models (LLMs).
  - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/chriseborowski/Polish-verb-conjugator)
